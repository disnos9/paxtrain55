***my name has been changed due to my school BLOCKING my github profile***

a frontend static HTML and CSS web developer

founder of **gspammer,** the *most powerful* email spammer out there. gspammer going public january 25th, 2024

## ok wtf
So basically my school uses goguardian and they HAVENT blocked **github.com** (bc some sites they use depend on github.com), but they've blocked THESE things and I AM MAD!t
- The keyword "VCEN" - victor chromebook exploiter news
- They keyword "disnos9" (i literally can't visit my own github profile, had to change my name to `paxtrain55` *sigh*
- They also blocked most of my organizations via keywords like:
- [dinoisfun](github.com/dinoisfun)
- mathgames67-69
- [cornbotdiscord](https://github.com/cornbotdiscord) (keyword that has already been blocked: discord)

This is gonna greatly affect my developing career... i can't even visit [my own paxtrain55/disnos9 repository](https://github.com/paxtrain55/disnos9) to delete it/rename it because THEY BLOCKED My NAME AS A KEYWORD

Sure, I've been suspended before for uhh... using **GSpammer** in my school, but uhh.. yeah 

and they just blocked this one too... yep, that's right. as i'm writing this, they just blocked this. im gonna... uhGHGH brO

- The keyword "paxtrain", which also blocks "paxtrain55"
